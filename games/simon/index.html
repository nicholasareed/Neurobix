			Dual n-back
			- display a grid (certain number)
			- create an array of total elements (9)
			- time differential between games (depends on JS setTimeout?)
			
			How many back are we going? Assume 1 back for now. 
			
			Logic Flow:
			- Display grid
			- Choose square to display
			- add that spot (value of array point) to history array
			- display color point (maybe change to shape later)
				- start color-removing setTimeout (after .5 seconds)
				- start Waiting for Input counter
					- say "here is what we are expecting to be pressed"
					- what "back" are we? 
						- Does that match up with what we are going to display (random)? 
						- Change the "expected" for Visual to yes/no
			- on "Same Spot" button pressed ("Visual"?)
				- is this a Yes or No press?
					- on Yes, add 1 point and turn into "unclickable" until next display
						- change to Green and text to "Good Job"
					- on No, subtract 1 point and turn "unclickable" until next display
						- change to Red and text to "Whoops"
			- how many times have we gone through?
				- end at 20 times (45 seconds?)
